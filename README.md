# 🚀 CLV Prediction & Customer Segmentation System
**An End-to-End AI Solution for E-Commerce: Analyzing 541,000+ Transactions to Predict Lifetime Value and Segment Customers.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project transforms raw e-commerce transaction data into actionable business intelligence. By leveraging a dataset of over **half a million transactions**, we built a sophisticated pipeline that predicts **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** and categorizes customers into behavioral segments using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

### 🎯 Business Goals
* **Predictive Analytics:** Estimate the total revenue a customer will generate.
* **Behavioral Segmentation:** Group customers to enable hyper-personalized marketing.
* **Interactive Insights:** Provide a real-time dashboard for marketing teams.
